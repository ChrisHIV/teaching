# teaching

Here you can find teaching material I've written. My publications are here and my home page is here.

## Basic maths, with public health and epidemiology examples:
* the [quiz](basic_maths/InductionQuiz.pdf) testing all of the material covered, and the [answers](basic_maths/QuizAnswers.pdf)
* basic manipulation of numbers - the [slides](basic_maths/Lecture1.pdf) for 2015 and prose-style [notes](basic_maths/Lecture1_2014.pdf) from 2014
* inequalities, functions and units - [slides](basic_maths/Lecture2.pdf) for 2015, [solutions](basic_maths/Lecture2_solutions.pdf) to the problems, and prose-style [notes](basic_maths/Lecture2_2014.pdf) from 2014
* probability parts [one](basic_maths/Lecture7_part1.pdf) and [two](basic_maths/Lecture7_part2.pdf)
* [calculus](basic_maths/PostXmas_Calculus.pdf) in more detail
* a bit of supplementary material about [trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions](basic_maths/Lecture3_SupplementaryNotes_2014.pdf), and [matrices](basic_maths/PostXmas_matrices.pdf)
I wrote these teaching materials (for a Bachelors course, a masters course and 'the short course' for professionals) while employed by Imperial College London, who have a claim on copyright. Do not re-use this material.

* a [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR2a46vBwGY) in which I talk through a subset of the slides from the above two lectures
* a computational practical showing how to use phyloscanner is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwygWUC73hnxbGtHSFpWdzYzVkk?resourcekey=0-Zjt4kVHja6Djo7qKsN3r5Q&usp=sharing)

Inference:
* Inferring things from quantitative data 
* The need for hierarchical models to infer things from naturally grouped data:
** slides
** Example R and Stan code
