# teaching

Here you can find educational material I've written. My publications are [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=OJ6t2UwAAAAJ) and my home page is [here](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/c-wymant).

### Basic maths, with public health and epidemiology examples:
* A [quiz](basic_maths/InductionQuiz.pdf) testing the topics covered, and the [answers](basic_maths/QuizAnswers.pdf)
* One set of [slides](basic_maths/ShortCourse_MathsRefresher2015_ChrisWymant.pdf) covering most of the material (the following slides go into a bit more detail)
* Basic manipulation of numbers - the [slides](basic_maths/Lecture1.pdf) for 2015 and prose-style [notes](basic_maths/Lecture1_2014.pdf) from 2014
* Inequalities, functions and units - [slides](basic_maths/Lecture2.pdf) for 2015, [solutions](basic_maths/Lecture2_solutions.pdf) to the problems, and prose-style [notes](basic_maths/Lecture2_2014.pdf) from 2014
* Probability parts [one](basic_maths/Lecture7_part1.pdf) and [two](basic_maths/Lecture7_part2.pdf)
* A bit of supplementary material about [calculus](basic_maths/PostXmas_Calculus.pdf) and [matrices](basic_maths/PostXmas_matrices.pdf)  

I wrote the above (for a Bachelors course, a masters course and 'the short course' for professionals) while employed by Imperial College London, who have a claim on copyright. Do not re-use this material.


### Other topics

Pathogen sequence analysis:
* Pathogen phylogenetic trees, and how to assemble viral genomes from genetic sequence data with shiver [here](other_topics/Wymant_Lecture1_shiver.pdf)
* Estimating who infected whom with phyloscanner [here](other_topics/Wymant_Lecture2_phyloscanner.pdf)
* A [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR2a46vBwGY) in which I talk through a subset of the slides from the above two lectures
* A computational practical showing how to use phyloscanner is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwygWUC73hnxbGtHSFpWdzYzVkk?resourcekey=0-Zjt4kVHja6Djo7qKsN3r5Q&usp=sharing). Being taught this practical was [apparently](https://www.krisp.org.za/blogs.php?id=48) "like receiving piano lessons from Beethoven;" YMMV
* An accessible summary of our discovery of the VB variant of HIV is [here](https://www.beehive.ox.ac.uk/hiv-lineage), and a webinar on the subject is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-M1MyXtHM)

Inference:
* Inferring things from quantitative data, or why it's better to stop thinking about _doing things to data_, [here](other_topics/2021-09-29_Chris_InferenceOnly.pdf)
* The need for hierarchical models to infer things from naturally grouped data: [slides](other_topics/2022-04-06_TrainingSession_Chris_HierarchicalModellingGroupedData.pdf) and the associated example [R](other_topics/HierarchicalSchools.R) and [Stan](other_topics/HierarchicalSchools.stan) code

A [blog post](https://www.coronavirus-fraser-group.org/blog#8august2021) explaining our group's paper modelling the effectiveness of daily lateral flow testing as an alternative strategy for reducing transmission from the traced close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 index cases.
