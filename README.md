## basic maths
While at Imperial I lectured Core Mathematics for public health and epidemiology (for a Bachelors course, a masters course and 'the short course' for professionals):
* the [quiz](basic_maths/InductionQuiz.pdf) testing all of the material covered, and the [answers](basic_maths/QuizAnswers.pdf)
* basic manipulation of numbers - the [slides](basic_maths/Lecture1.pdf) for 2015 and prose-style [notes](basic_maths/Lecture1_2014.pdf) from 2014
* inequalities, functions and units - [slides](basic_maths/Lecture2.pdf) for 2015, [solutions](basic_maths/Lecture2_solutions.pdf) to the problems, and prose-style [notes](basic_maths/Lecture2_2014.pdf) from 2014
* probability parts [one](basic_maths/Lecture7_part1.pdf) and [two](basic_maths/Lecture7_part2.pdf)
* [calculus](basic_maths/PostXmas_Calculus.pdf) in more detail
* a bit of supplementary material about [trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions](basic_maths/Lecture3_SupplementaryNotes_2014.pdf), and [matrices](basic_maths/PostXmas_matrices.pdf)
