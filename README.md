# teaching

Here you can find educational material I've written. My publications are [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=OJ6t2UwAAAAJ) and my home page is [here](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/c-wymant).

### Basic maths, with public health and epidemiology examples:
* A [quiz](basic_maths/InductionQuiz.pdf) testing the topics covered, and the [answers](basic_maths/QuizAnswers.pdf)
* One set of [slides](basic_maths/ShortCourse_MathsRefresher2015_ChrisWymant.pdf) covering most of the material (the following slides go into a bit more detail)
* Basic manipulation of numbers - the [slides](basic_maths/Lecture1.pdf) for 2015 and prose-style [notes](basic_maths/Lecture1_2014.pdf) from 2014
* Inequalities, functions and units - [slides](basic_maths/Lecture2.pdf) for 2015, [solutions](basic_maths/Lecture2_solutions.pdf) to the problems, and prose-style [notes](basic_maths/Lecture2_2014.pdf) from 2014
* Probability parts [one](basic_maths/Lecture7_part1.pdf) and [two](basic_maths/Lecture7_part2.pdf)
* A bit of supplementary material about [calculus](basic_maths/PostXmas_Calculus.pdf) and [matrices](basic_maths/PostXmas_matrices.pdf)  

I wrote the above (for a Bachelors course, a masters course and 'the short course' for professionals) while employed by Imperial College London, who have a claim on copyright. Do not re-use this material.


### Other topics

Pathogen sequence analysis:
* [Pathogen phylogenetic trees, and how to assemble viral genomes from genetic sequence data with shiver](other_topics/Wymant_Lecture1_shiver.pdf)
* [Estimating who infected whom with phyloscanner](other_topics/Wymant_Lecture2_phyloscanner.pdf)
* A [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR2a46vBwGY) in which I talk through a subset of the slides from the above two lectures
* A computational practical showing how to use phyloscanner is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwygWUC73hnxbGtHSFpWdzYzVkk?resourcekey=0-Zjt4kVHja6Djo7qKsN3r5Q&usp=sharing). Being taught this practical was [apparently](https://www.krisp.org.za/blogs.php?id=48) "like receiving piano lessons from Beethoven;" YMMV
* An accessible summary of our discovery of the VB variant of HIV is [here](https://www.beehive.ox.ac.uk/hiv-lineage), and a webinar on the subject is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-M1MyXtHM)

Inference:
* [Inferring things from quantitative data](other_topics/2021-09-29_Chris_InferenceOnly.pdf), or why it's better to stop thinking about _doing things to data_
* The need for hierarchical models to infer things from naturally grouped data: [slides](other_topics/2022-04-06_TrainingSession_Chris_HierarchicalModellingGroupedData.pdf) and the associated example [R](other_topics/HierarchicalSchools.R) and [Stan](other_topics/HierarchicalSchools.stan) code

A [blog post](https://www.coronavirus-fraser-group.org/blog#8august2021) explaining our group's paper modelling the effectiveness of daily lateral flow testing as an alternative strategy for reducing transmission from the traced close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 index cases.

A few twitter highlights:
* On the harmful oversimplification present in statements like 'the link between severe covid outcomes and infection has been broken' or "covid's infection fatality rate is now like flu so we should treat it like flu', [here](https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1412436234845175812)
* The effect of lockdowns [here](https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1321543816298614784)
* Our group's agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and interventions [here](https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1308751845997903881)
* Calling the pandemic by taking the temperature of experts [here](https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1231635888595197952)
* Some of the best people to follow on climate, for when I used to have the bandwidth for that, [here](https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1225491802574217220)
* A round-up of experts advocating taking to the streets for climate action [here](https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1180468223889874945)
* A pet hate: scientists leveraging/harnessing things left, right and centre instead of using them [here](https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1082201811640086528)

For experts I've also written summaries of some conferences:
* [Epidemics8](https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1465775301972185088) (2001) 
* [COVID-19: Advances and Remaining Challenges] (https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1443248100143927296) (2021)
* [Virus Genomics and Evolution](https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1438178907438653441) (2021)
* Human Virus Dynamics and Evolution 2021 [here](https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1390733002754379784)
* Net Zero 2019 [here](https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1171361818847121408)

Two things I wrote while not funded by those grants:
* Climate change, and how we're fucking up the planet and nature generally: [slides](other_topics/GroupMeeting_ClimateStuff_BoxesWithinBoxes.pdf)
* An [explanation](other_topics/The_5-1_explained.pdf) of the "5-1" system of service receive for volleyball
