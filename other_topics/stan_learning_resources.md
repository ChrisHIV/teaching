NB “We recommend working through this guide using the textbooks _Bayesian Data Analysis_ (BDA3) and _Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan_ as references on the concepts”.
BDA3 is available for free [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/); Appendix C, p591, is _Computation in R and Stan_.  
The Statistical Rethinking book is not free, but its associated lecture course is, [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJK6_DZvcMqNSzQdEkzvzA).
* Stan [tutorials page](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/tutorials)
* The lectures [here](https://ben-lambert.com/bayesian-lecture-slides/) by Ben Lambert are a great introduction to Bayesian inference.
Lecture 6 gets into Stan specifically.
