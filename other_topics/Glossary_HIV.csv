EHI,,early HIV infection. The first 3–6 months after infection. Includes acute HIV infection (AHI).,DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001232
HIV set point,,"the viral load of a person infected with HIV, which stabilizes after a period of acute HIV infection. The set point is reached after the immune system has developed specific Cytotoxic T cells and begins to attempt to fight the virus. The higher the viral load of the set point, the faster the virus will progress to AIDS; the lower the viral load of the set point, the longer the patient will remain in clinical latency. The only effective way to lower the set point is through highly active antiretroviral therapy. The set point is not completely fixed and constant, but can be quite dynamic with significant fluctuations.",wikipedia

T-cells may recognize these complexes using their T-cell receptors (TCRs). T cells cannot recognize, and therefore cannot respond to, 'free' antigen. T cells can only 'see' an antigen that has been processed and presented by cells via carrier molecules like MHC and CD1 molecules.",wikipedia

Cytokines,,"a broad and loose category of small proteins (~5–20 kDa) that are important in cell signaling - they are released by cells and affect the behavior of other cells, and sometimes the releasing cell itself. They act through receptors, and are especially important in the immune system.",wikipedia
Cytokine storm,cytokine cascade,"a positive feedback loop between cytokines and immune cells. When the immune system is fighting pathogens, cytokines signal immune cells such as T-cells and macrophages to travel to the site of infection. In addition, cytokines activate those cells, stimulating them to produce more cytokines. Normally, this feedback loop is kept in check by the body. However, in some instances, the reaction becomes uncontrolled, and too many immune cells are activated in a single place. The precise reason for this is not entirely understood but may be caused by an exaggerated response when the immune system encounters a new and highly pathogenic invader. Cytokine storms have potential to do significant damage to body tissues and organs.",wikipedia

Seroconversion,,"the development of detectable specific antibodies to microorganisms in the blood serum as a result of infection or immunization. Before the seroconversion point, the antigen is prevalent and the corresponding antibody is not detectable in sera.
