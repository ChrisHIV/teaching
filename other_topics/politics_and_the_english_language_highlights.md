I recommend reading Orwell's 13-page essay Politics and the English Language before writing to make a point: it's a good argument for clarity and simplicity, drawing attention to silly things people to do make their writing sound impressive which are common in modern scientific writing in my experience.
It's online [here](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/); below are a few of my favourite bits.
Italics are Orwell's.

"an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so on indefinitely.
A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks.
It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language.
It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.
The point is that the process is reversible.
Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble."

(I'm convinced that the use of "leverage", "harness" etc. instead of "use" is following [a contagious process](https://twitter.com/ChrisWymant/status/1082201811640086528).)

"Characteristic phrases are: _render inoperative, militate against, make contact with, be subjected to, give rise to, give grounds for, have the effect of, play a leading part (role) in, make itself felt, take effect, exhibit a tendency to, serve the purpose of,_ etc. etc.
The keynote is the elimination of simple verbs.
Instead of being a single word... a verb becomes a _phrase_

"I am going to translate a passage of good English into modern English of the worst sort.
Here is a well-known verse from _Ecclesiastes_:
> I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.  

Here it is in modern English:
> Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account."

"modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer.
It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug.
The attraction of this way of writing is that it is easy.
It is easier - even quicker, once you have the habit - to say _In my opinion it is a not-unjustifiable assumption that_ than to say _I think_."

"I think the following rules will cover most cases.  
(i) Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.  
(ii) Never use a long word where a short one will do.  
(iii) If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out [c.f. "Omit needless words" - rule 17 of [Strunk and White](http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf)].  
(iv) Never use the passive where you can use the active.  
(v) Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.  
(vi) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous."
