## Advice on writing a scientific paper (in academia)

Other recommended resources:

* *Strunk and White* is helpful for writing anything: it's very concise and has good general guidelines.
It's online [here](http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf).
* *Politics and the English Language* is helpful for writing to make a point.
It's a good argument for clarity and simplicity, drawing attention to common silly things people to do make their writing sound impressive.
It's online [here](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/).
A few of my favourite bits are [here](politics_and_the_english_language_highlights.md).
* *Several short sentences about writing* is an enjoyable and useful read for those with greater interest in writing, though isn't the place to start from.
I think its advice is aimed more at creative writing, though a good amount of it applies to academic writing, including my favourite passages [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XK51VXUtFraqo193646RYMoGMyHa9dIn-Fwy9maC_TA/edit?usp=sharing).

### Use a question-driven approach

Start by getting as clear as you can in your head about what question your work addresses.
Anecdotally, I find a fairly common structure in talks (less so papers) by junior scientists is  
* An introduction to the general area of study,
* What you did, in great detail (before you learn from experience that while this shows how much you had to struggle, everyone struggles at the start of something new, and these details can usually be summarised or omitted with no loss of your audience's understanding),
* What the result of doing that was,
* Speculation as to why that might be of interest to the general area: which hypotheses the result (dis)favours.
  
That’s not a compelling structure, because as one follows, it’s less clear _why_ you’re doing what you’re doing.
**Finish your introduction with the specific question you attempted to answer, explaining why that question matters**.
This means that people have understood _where_ you're trying to get to as they then follow your explanation for _how_ you tried to get there, which is much clearer and more satisfying.
It means people are either hooked from your introduction onwards, or they realise as early as possible that what you’ve done isn’t relevant for them and they can save their mental bandwidth for something else.
There are too many papers and too many talks: help people to know if yours is right for them.
I suspect that the uncompelling structure above arises because the author is writing too narrowly from their own perspective (which is also responsible for failure to explain things that are very familiar to the author).
An important point beyond the use of a question-driven approach is to _identify your audience and write your paper bearing in mind their perspective_.

The question you present is not necessarily the same question that you actually set out to answer at the start of your project: there's nothing wrong with finding some result and then realising afterwards that it answers someone else’s important question. And you might want to revisit the question you started with depending what you found, e.g. restrict the scope if you realise there are problems with generalisability.

I feel (I am perhaps biased) that an exception to this question-focussed approach is when you discover a thing that exists (or existed) that wasn’t known to exist, e.g. a [viral variant](https://www.beehive.ox.ac.uk/hiv-lineage) with certain properties, or a volcano, or an ancient language. There’s not necessarily an obvious question preceding such findings. One could try to shoehorn any finding into this exception, e.g. “I discovered that there exists a statistically significant correlation between variables x and y in my data,” but the fact that you could do something doesn't mean you should. Generally, people are interested in what you find in your data only to the extent that we can generalise from it to something bigger. Which means e.g. considering whether the data you started with was a good thing to start with for the question in hand. So it's better not to shoehorn but to challenge oneself to construct a question to which one’s findings provide a reasonable answer (such as does actionable thing X cause desirable outcome Y).

I've heard people say that scientific work should always be testing some hypothesis.
I heard one reply providing the counter-example of counting species in a given area to record biodiversity: there is no hypothesis being tested.
Both sides here have a point.
If you fish around in your data for anything interesting and then later construct some explanation for what you found, you're at risk of misinterpreting random chance in the data, worsening the reproducibility crisis.
However, reducing science to the 'testing' of a hypothesis is overly reductionist $^\dagger$.
Scientific work should aim to discriminate between different hypotheses, and these may form a continuous space rather than just two possibilities, such as the spatial density of species.
This is similar to saying we should start from a question: we should be investigating how the evidence discriminates between different possible answers.

### Structure your writing at the level of paragraphs

Plan what you are going to write, and make sure you understand what you have already written, at the level of paragraphs.
Each paragraph should
* collect sentences that are related to each other with an easily definable theme
* avoid repeating something from a previous paragraph (unless this is intentional for emphasis, especially between Discussion and Results),
* come in a coherent flow of ideas from one paragraph to the next.

To ensure that your writing is structured at the level of paragraphs, maintain a list of very short bullet points saying what the main point of each paragraph is.
You'll need to keep that list in sync with the actual paragraphs as you write them - switching between modifying the structure and modifying the actual text until the two things match each other and the plan matches the structure you want.
Depending on what mood you're currently in, it can be better to plan your structure (big-picture thinking) or craft text to match your desired structure (fleshing out details).
Keep that plan visible when you share your draft with co-authors: it's helpful for them to see at a glance what your structure is supposed to be, instead of them each needing to figure it out.
If you start the writing process by creating a draft of this list, that’s a great point at which to get early feedback from co-authors, because the whole point and structure of the paper is clear at a glance and can easily be turned into something different with minimal wasted writing.

As an example of this approach, I might start by writing this paragraph structure for my Discussion section:  
1. summary: what we did, what we found, how we interpret that finding  
2. refer to previous studies  
3. limitation: non-representative data limits generalisability  
4. limitation: demonstrated correlation not causation  
5. outlook, what should (some) people do now in light of this result
  
I might show this to a coauthor who can tell me immediately that our data is much more representative that I thought, so there's no need to write paragraph 4 (saving my time writing it and her time reading it).
Then I might start to write the actual paragraphs and realise there's so much to say on interpretation that a whole paragraph would be better, in which we should talk about novelty, because interpretation and novelty both help people understand why they should care about this result.
So I'd revise my structure to

1. summary of what we did and what we found  
2. why we care: how we interpret that finding and why it's novel  
3. refer to previous studies  
4. limitation: correlation not causation  
5. outlook, what should (some) people do now in light of this result

(Variations on the above structures generally work well for the results section of a results-focussed paper; adjustment is needed for a methods-focussed paper.) 

Another example: I might take a section of my paper that I already wrote without an explicit structure accompanying it, and then try to write such a list to match what I've already written.
As a result I might identify some problems with my existing structure, e.g. one paragraph without an easily identifiable theme, or one point repeated in multiple paragraphs when those sentences would be better collected together.
I would then move around sentences (or delete them) until the text has a sensible paragraph structure.

Having an explicit written list for what the paragraph structure is will help you and your coauthors write text with good structure.
Of course you won't include that list with the actual final text, and so your broad readership won't see quite so easily what the paragraph structure is.
To help them, try to make the opening sentence of each paragraph indicate what the rest of the rest of the paragraph will be about.

The Introduction section should have a roughly funnel structure from broad to specific, ending with an explanation of what you set out to do in this paper: “Here, we...“. I read somewhere, and agree, that the funnel should be such that the closing bit about your work should feel inevitable - you’ve drawn the reader towards your question feeling like the natural thing to work on. In the best case you have provided something completely novel, in which case immediately before your “Here, we...” is an explanation of how no one has looked at this problem before. Normally your result is more incremental, and you can say that uncertainty remains on this particular aspect of a phenomenon, or that the problem is so important that further studies are useful to validate existing results. An example funnel:
* one paragraph on the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales
* one paragraph on contact tracing as an approach to reduce the spread of COVID-19 
* one paragraph on digital contact tracing (using proximity-detecting smartphone apps)
* one paragraph on previous studies of digital contact tracing, mentioning the absence of and the importance of empirical estimates of epidemiological impact
* "Here, we empirically estimated the epidemiological impact of digital contact tracing in England and Wales. We do this by... [very brief summary of data and method]"

### Other considerations

**Write to be understood as clearly as possible.**
Do not use your writing style to try to make the work sound more impressive.
If impressing people is your aim, have something impressive to say (in which case being as clear as possible helps your aim); if you don't, using an impressive-sounding style makes you a salesperson for a crappy car - it's not a good look.
_Use_ methods and _analyse_ data: don't leverage them or harness them.
_A methodology_ is a class of methods - are you sure that's what you mean rather than _a method_?
A single method can still have aspects of it that can be adjusted in different applications; this doesn't mean we should promote it to being a class of methods.
_Methodologies_ can almost always be replaced by _methods_.

**Think about what you will write at a high-level - the big picture - before writing details.**
I’ve heard a recommendation to start by writing the methods section first, because writing what you did and how is relatively easy, and this helps get your foot into in the writing process.
However, grappling with the construction of a narrative for your work may make you realise that part of what you’ve done is unnecessary, or that something you haven’t done is necessary, or that it would be better to split into several papers.
Such realisations or decisions might mean you'll then want to describe the details differently.

**Think about what people should do differently as a result of what you’ve found.**
I look for this in every presentation or paper. For a methods paper, it’s normally to use that method instead of the best previous alternative for this particular application. For applied results papers, it might be that doctors/society should consider using more X to get more of desirable outcome Y, or at least that further study should establish your X-Y link more concretely and explore feasibility, cost-effectiveness etc. For theoretical results papers, it might be that other researchers should investigate your new idea because it has the potential to help us understand something which is manifestly important. For a convincing negative result - enough data for statistical power, appropriate kind of data & method for accuracy and generalisability - the implication might be that people should stop pursuing an avenue previously thought to be promising. There are lots of possibilities for how your finding might influence some people. If you struggle to think concretely of who and how, it’s worth having a frank conversation with yourself about whether your paper was a good use of your time. There is no use in crying over spilt milk of course, but one can strive to not continue spilling milk forever. (This was a big factor in why I stopped working on theoretical particle physics.)

**Clearly establish and then stick to a one-to-one mapping between [things] and [the names we use to refer to those things].**
A one-to-one map makes it as clear as possible for the reader and frees up their concentration for more important things.
Using different terms to refer to the same thing may leave the reader thinking they're different; using the same term to mean different things may leave the reader thinking they're the same.

**Express coordinate ideas in similar form** - rule 19 of [Strunk and White](http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf). The previous point was about the benefit of repeating names; repeating your decision for how to write similar sentences helps the reader to see both the similarities and the differences.
Compare:  
_Authors A used method a and found result X [A]. Result Y was obtained [b] leveraging methodology b. Employing c, C et al [C] demonstrated Z._  
with something like  
_A et al used method a and found X [A]. B et al used method b and found Y [B]. C et al used method c and found Z [C]._  
The latter is certainly drier but easier to parse.
Recall that coercing data into [tidy format](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) (rectangular, one row per observation, one column per aspect of the observation i.e. per variable) makes the data clearer as well as easier to operate on (though obviously some data is naturally of a different structure, such as trees).
In the same way, coercing two or more similar sentences (or clauses within a sentence) into a common structure helps to clarify both their similarities and their differences for lower mental effort.

**Past tense is typically best throughout Methods (what you _did_) and Results (what you _found_).**
Present and future tense is best reserved for Introduction or Discussion.
Paraphrasing an explanation I was given: mathematicians and physicists favour the present tense for results because there is a feel of timelessness to the findings (x _equals_ y and always will).
However, in biomedical research, different findings are fairly often in some tension with each other; a single finding is just a higher level of a single observation within a study.  
Introduction: x and y have been studied, but the relationship *is* unclear.  
Methods: We *regressed* y against x.  
Results: We *found* a correlation.  
Discussion: We *interpret* this as evidence that x *causes* y, given the assumed absence of confounders. We *think* that an intervention to reduce x *will* reduce y.  

**Use the active tense for what you did: *We did X*.**
Recommendations to use the passive tense (*X was done*) to sound more neutral are so last century.
I read somewhere that the active tense reminds the reader that the steps taken were made by fallible humans, not by some idealised notion of the scientific process.
I agree.
There can also be genuine ambiguity about who did the thing that was done if you're also talking about previous work, and it's important to distinguish work done here from everything that came before.
The passive tense is fine for describing previous work that you cite -- the citation makes clear who did it (X has been studied [1]) without burdening the reader with many names that are irrelevant for your argument (Smith et al. studied X [1]).

**Report results to the appropriate level of precision.**
For numerical values, that's a choice for the number of significant figures.
(If you're unfamiliar with the concept, you should google it, though a basic example may suffice: 36, 36000, 3.6 x 10^5, and 0.00036 are all quoted to 2 significant figures.)
Two factors are relevant: the precision with which you know the value, and the maximum precision that any of your readers might care about (remembering that the most interested readers will want to dive into the underlying data and not just copy-paste your derived values).
You should use the smaller of these two.
A first example: if my friend asks me when I'm going on holiday, I would not reply 09:39 on August 3rd even though I know my departure time to that level of precision: that would be more precision than they care about.
A second example: if I observe 100 successes out of 300 trials, it would be silly to report the success probability as 0.33333333 not only because no-one cares about the later digits but because I am extremely uncertain what their values should be.
For simplicity let us say I report Frequentist confidence intervals as a quantification of uncertainty (a common [abuse](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-015-0947-8) of the concept of uncertainty), obtaining the interval 0.2808136 - 0.3901981 from running `prop.test(100, 300)` in R.
This range is adequately summarised as 0.28 - 0.39, because including a third significant figure would be a negligibly small change compared to the size of the range itself.
Then for consistency we should quote our central estimate to two significant figures too: we report our estimate of the success probability as 0.33 (95% CI: 0.28 - 0.39).
If reporting p-values (read elsewhere, e.g. [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V2igitQVFnQRIWGupmmbA3GqvX8DgAeLI0taH36oJNI/edit?usp=sharing), for issues with that), one significant figure is usually best, occasionally two, never more.
No-one's conclusion will be different if you report p = 0.0589 instead of p = 0.06.
An exception to these considerations is tables of numerical values: where these are automatically generated and contain many values, it would take a lot of work (and perhaps look a little untidy) to adjust the number of significant figures for every cell in the table independently.
In this case it is forgivable for the author to make one choice of the most appropriate number of significant figures (or decimal places) and apply this to the whole table (or to each row or to each column, where these have values with very different sizes).

**When explaining why what you've done is valuable, be specific.**
Phrases like "our work sheds light on", "our work has implications for" leave unsaid what you actually learned or what the implications are.
If you don't tell the reader concretely what the benefits of your work are, they may be left suspicious that there are none.
A related point is discussed in the book Freakonomics: adverts for expensive houses tend to use specific words (titanium) whereas adverts for cheap houses tend to use vague words (lovely).

### Commonly needed points of grammar

**Hyphenate modifiers correctly.**
When we write A B C where C is a noun and A and B are modifiers, the rule is to hyphenate A-B if and only if A and B work together to form a single composite modifier (the most common example being that A modifies B), not hyphenating if and only if A and B separately modify C.
e.g. a strange smelling cheese is a cheese that is strange and which has the ability (or purpose) of smelling.
A strange-smelling cheese is a cheese that smells strange.
I like the recommendation of the Chicago Manual of Style to break this rule when A is an adverb that ends in "ly", because ending in "ly" means it's obviously an adverb and adverbs only modify adjectives or verbs, never nouns, so there's no ambiguity about what A is modifying.
e.g. a "significantly improved method" is just as clear and more stylish than a "significantly-improved method".
Hyphenation is for when the modifiers precede the noun, not when they follow it.
e.g. the aforementioned cheese is strange smelling, not strange-smelling.
Excessive hyphenation can be avoided by moving modfiers to after the noun or other restructuring of the sentence.
For example, in our research group we might say that our data was obtained using [veSEQ-HIV](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32669382/): a whole-genome deep-sequencing Illumina-platform high-throughput quantitative method. Alternatively we could say we did whole-genome deep sequencing on the Illumina platform with veSEQ-HIV -- a quantitative high-throughput method using bait capture.

Don’t put a comma between a verb and its subject, even if the subject is a long composite noun, unless you have two commas with parenthetical functioning. This is correct: _the approach used to solve this problem was tested..._ So is this: _this approach, used to solve this problem, was tested..._ This is not: _the approach used to solve this problem, was tested..._

For describing what you did and what you found, use the simple past tense (e.g. we did this).
The present perfect tense (e.g. we have done this) communicates whether we are currently in state of this thing ever having been done previously, yes or no.
Examples where this makes sense: _It has not been shown whether X affects Y_ in Introduction, and _We have shown that X affects Y_ in Discussion.
The latter is virtually the same as _We showed that_, but conveys a sense of definitiveness: we have shown this, it has now been shown, so people need not wonder about this any more.
The present perfect tense does not make sense for describing what you did and what you found, which is best understood as a series of steps in order.

### Placeholders for points I hope to explain properly later

Aim to write shorter sentences: they're harder to get wrong and easier to fix.
More detail [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XK51VXUtFraqo193646RYMoGMyHa9dIn-Fwy9maC_TA/edit?usp=sharing).

A little bit of present tense may sometimes be helpful in the Results section.
If the meaning of something you've found is not clear, a short statement of what this suggests about the world (present tense) may benefit readers. The full discussion about how your findings can be interpreted is best placed in Discussion. 

Ask your coauthors if anything should be cut: less is sometimes more, and the author sometimes feels unduly attached to things they've written ('kill your darlings' may be hard advice to follow).
Also ask them if the narrative would make more sense if points are reordered: they may be able to see more clearly than you, having not been as closely involved in the process.

Avoid making any statements that are true trivially, e.g. true by definition (1=1) or just very obvious: they cheapen the non-trivial things you say.
One exception is at the very start of your paper when setting context, because you need to get people with various levels and areas of expertise on the same page (e.g. "HIV continues to be a major global health burden"). Another is at the very end, if your results add weight to an argument that is arguably obvious but perhaps not accepted or acted upon in practise (e.g. "It remains critical to minimise barriers to HIV treatment").

Describe materials and methods in chronological order, following the data on a journey from its original setting to how it was obtained and processed from raw to simplified/abstracted. For example in infectious disease epidemilogy we might start with the affected population (describe the epidemic), the cohort (with its inclusion criteria / sampling process), how we obtained repeat visits from each person, how you obtained biological samples from each visit, what experiment we ran on each sample, how we simplified each experimental result from complex data into simple data, what inclusion criteria / imputation you applied to the simple data, and finally what steps we ran on simple data for the main analysis.

Only define acronyms/abbreviations for things you use many times, to avoid putting unnecessary strain on the reader’s memory.

If you need to mention something before you can explain it properly, be defensive against readers misinterpreting it and only catching their error later. At a minimum something like “(see later clarification)” can signpost the reader that they might be better off waiting before thinking about this much. In papers where the Results section comes before Methods, you don’t need to put “(see Methods)” after every mention of something methodological - it’s implicit.

$^\dagger$ I suspect that focussing too narrowly on 'testing' a hypothesis probably comes from a frequentist statistics tradition of rejecting or failing to reject a null hypothesis.
As Andrew Gelman pithily [summarises](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/06/17/bayesians-are-frequentists/): "I do model checking to test the model that I am fitting, usually not to test a straw-man null hypothesis.
I already know my model is false, so I don’t pat myself on the back for finding problems with the fit (thus "rejecting" the model); rather, when I find problems with fit, this motivates improvement to the model." We should be investigating how the evidence discriminates between different possible answers, and knowing that one answer provides a poor explanation of the data does not mean we should reject it: logically, we must also show that at least one other plausible answer provides a good explanation of the data.
